TERMS OF SERVICE
Effective Date: February 2, 2026 Last Updated: February 2, 2026

1. Introduction & Acceptance
These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a binding legal agreement between you ("User," "You") and VocoWeb ("we," "us," "our"), regarding your access to and use of the VocoWeb website and application building platform (the "Service").

By registering for an account, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

NOTICE REGARDING BETA STATUS: Please note that VocoWeb is currently in Beta 1.0. The Service is still under active development and may contain bugs, errors, or feature limitations. You acknowledge that you are using the Service at your own risk.

2. Description of Service
VocoWeb is an AI-powered development platform that assists users in building, deploying, and hosting web applications. We provide the infrastructure (hosting, authentication, databases) and AI tools to generate code.

3. Intellectual Property & Ownership
A. Your Ownership (No Lock-In) You retain full ownership of the intellectual property rights to the applications, code, databases, and content you create using VocoWeb ("User Projects"). We do not claim ownership over your business logic or generated source code. You are free to export your code and host it elsewhere at any time.

B. Our License to You We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our Service to build and host your applications in accordance with these Terms.

C. Our Rights VocoWeb retains all rights to the underlying platform, pre-built infrastructure modules (e.g., the "Foundry" dashboard, proprietary deployment scripts), and our AI orchestration engine.

4. AI Limitations & User Responsibility
A. AI "Hallucinations" & Errors You acknowledge that VocoWeb uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate code. AI can make mistakes, generate insecure code, or "hallucinate" functionality that does not exist.
You are the final editor: You are solely responsible for reviewing, testing, and securing the code generated by VocoWeb before deploying it to a production environment.
No Warranty on Code: We do not guarantee that AI-generated code will be error-free, secure, or suitable for any specific purpose.
B. Liability for Business Losses VocoWeb is a tool, not a CTO. We are not liable for any financial losses, data breaches, or business interruptions caused by bugs in the applications you build using our Service.

5. Accounts & Security
Registration: You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account.
Credentials: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and API keys. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
Notification: You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
6. Payment, Subscriptions, and Refunds
A. Subscription Plans VocoWeb offers paid subscription plans (e.g., "Builder," "Founder"). You agree to pay the fees associated with your chosen plan. Payments are processed by our third-party Merchant of Record.

B. Cancellation You may cancel your subscription at any time via your dashboard. Your access to paid features will continue until the end of the current billing cycle.

C. No Refunds on Usage Due to the significant costs of AI computation and infrastructure, we do not offer refunds for partial months or unused time, nor do we offer refunds based on dissatisfaction with specific AI outputs.

7. Fair Use Policy ("Unlimited" Iterations)
To maintain the quality of our Service for all users, "Unlimited AI Iterations" are subject to this Fair Use Policy:
Human-Speed Usage: The Service is intended for human developers. Automated scripts, bots, or excessive usage patterns that suggest non-human interaction (e.g., thousands of requests per hour) are prohibited.
Account Sharing: Sharing a single account among multiple developers to avoid paying for seats is prohibited.
Remedy: If we detect abuse, we reserve the right to throttle your request speed or temporarily suspend your account until usage returns to normal levels.
8. Prohibited Uses
You agree not to use VocoWeb to:
Build applications that facilitate illegal activities, fraud, or harassment.
Host malicious code, viruses, or spyware.
Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or hack the VocoWeb platform.
Resell the VocoWeb API or infrastructure without our express written permission.
9. Termination
We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.
Data Export: In the event of termination (unless for malicious illegal activity), we will provide a reasonable window (30 days) for you to export your Project Data.
10. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. VOCOWEB EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT (I) THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR (III) THE RESULTS (CODE/APPS) OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.

11. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL VOCOWEB BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM.

12. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the VocoWeb operating entity is located, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
