PRIVACY POLICY
Effective Date: February 2, 2026 Last Updated: February 2, 2026

1. Introduction
Welcome to VocoWeb. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your intellectual property.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website https://www.google.com/search?q=vocoweb.com (the "Site") and use our AI-powered application building services (the "Service").

We built VocoWeb to be the "adult in the room" regarding infrastructure and data safety. Unlike other platforms, we treat your project data as your asset, not ours.

2. Information We Collect
We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, or could reasonably be linked to you ("Personal Data").

A. Information You Provide to Us
Account Information: Name, email address, and password when you register.
Billing Information: If you subscribe to a paid plan (Builder/Founder), our payment processors (acting as our Merchant of Record partners) collect your billing address and payment method details. We do not store raw credit card numbers on our servers.
Project Data: The code, assets, databases, text prompts, and architectural specifications you input into VocoWeb to build your applications.
Support Data: Information you provide when contacting customer support or reporting bugs.
B. Information We Collect Automatically
Usage Data: Details of your visits to our Site, including traffic data, logs, and other communication data.
Device Data: IP address, operating system, and browser type.
Cookies: We use cookies to manage sessions and authentication. We do not use third-party tracking cookies to sell your data to advertisers.
3. How We Use Your Information
We use your data for the following specific purposes:
To Provide the Service: Creating accounts, spinning up your isolated MicroVMs, and managing your deployments.
To Power the AI Builder: Your prompts and code context are sent to our AI providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) solely for the purpose of generating your requested code.
To Process Payments: Facilitating transactions through our Merchant of Record infrastructure.
To Ensure Security: Monitoring for bot attacks, abuse of our "Unlimited Iteration" policy, and unauthorized access attempts.
To Communicate: Sending transactional emails (invoices, password resets) and product updates.
4. Your Code & AI Training (The "No-Theft" Guarantee)
We know you are building a business, not just a toy. Your intellectual property is paramount.
Ownership: You retain full ownership of all code, assets, and databases generated within VocoWeb.
AI Training Policy: We do not use your private project code to train our public AI models. Your proprietary algorithms and business logic remain confidential.
Isolation: Your code runs in isolated MicroVMs. It is not shared with other users, nor does it "leak" into a shared knowledge base.
5. Sharing Your Information
We do not sell your Personal Data. We only share information in the following limited circumstances:
Service Providers: With trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website (e.g., cloud hosting providers, payment processors, email services), provided they agree to keep this information confidential.
Legal Compliance: If required by law, regulation, or legal process (e.g., a court order or subpoena), or to protect the rights, property, or safety of VocoWeb, our users, or others.
Business Transfers: In connection with a merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition.
6. Data Retention & Export
Retention: We retain your account information and project data for as long as your account is active.
The "Eject Button": Unlike competitors who lock you in, you may export your full source code (GitHub/ZIP) and database dumps at any time.
Deletion: If you delete your account, your Personal Data and Project Data are permanently removed from our active databases within 30 days. Backups may be retained for a limited period for disaster recovery purposes before being overwritten.
7. Security of Your Data
We implement enterprise-grade security measures to protect your data:
Encryption: Data is encrypted in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest.
Isolation: We use MicroVM technology to strictly isolate your application's environment from other tenants.
Access Control: Access to your private data by our staff is restricted to necessary personnel and logged.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

9. Children's Privacy
Our Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date."
