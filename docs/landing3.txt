The Operating System for Business.
Phase 1 is Live.
Sub-headline: Most AI tools generate code. VocoWeb is architecting the first end-to-end platform to validate, build, and operate sustainable companies. The VocoBuild Engine is now open for access.

THE MANIFESTO (Replacing "The Problem")
(Visual: Minimalist text on a dark background. High contrast.)

Headline:

Code is a Commodity. Structure is the Asset.
Body Copy: The modern founder is lost in fragmentation. You research in ChatGPT, plan in Notion, code in Replit, and struggle with AWS. Context evaporates. Momentum dies.

We are building the solution: A unified Business Operating System.

We are not releasing a toy. We are releasing a standard. We are rolling out the VocoWeb architecture in three phases. You are joining us at Phase 1.

THE MASTER PLAN (The Product Grid)
(Design Note: This uses the "Ghost UI" technique. The Builder is bright. The others are "Loading/Constructing" to show the roadmap.)

01. VocoResearch [ PHASE 2: IN DEVELOPMENT ]
Headline: Intelligence, Not Intuition. Copy: We are training deep-search agents to validate market demand before you commit resources. Status: Deploying Q3 2026. Join Phase 1 to secure priority access.

02. VocoStrategy [ PHASE 2: IN DEVELOPMENT ]
Headline: The AI Product Manager. Copy: Converting unstructured notes into formal Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and database schemas. No more vague prompts. Status: In internal beta testing.

03. VocoBuild [ PHASE 1: LIVE NOW ]
Headline: Industrial-Grade Generation. Copy: The core of the system is ready. Generate clean, production-ready React & Node.js applications. The Difference:
Zero Token Metering: Build without watching a ticking clock.
Webcontainer Architecture: Your app runs in isolated Firecracker VMs, not fragile sandboxes.
Export Native: You own the code. Download the full repository at any time.
04. The Foundry [ PHASE 3: COMING SOON ]
Headline: Operational Sovereignty. Copy: The integrated backbone for global tax, payments, and identity management. Status: Architecting the financial layer.

THE "WHY NOW?" BLOCK
(Addressing the objection: "Why should I use you if the other stuff isn't ready?")

Headline:

Build Today. Ready for Tomorrow.
Copy: Why start with VocoWeb's builder now? Because the applications you generate today are being structured for the ecosystem of tomorrow.

When VocoResearch and The Foundry go live, your existing VocoWeb codebase will integrate seamlessly. Don't build legacy code on other platforms. Build future-proof code here.

FAQ (Honest & Direct)
Q: Why are some features locked? A: We are building a Business Operating System, not just a chatbot. We refuse to release the Intelligence Layer (Research/Strategy) until it meets our standard of accuracy. Phase 1 is focused purely on the Build Engine.

Q: Can I really export my code? A: Yes. You are building a business, not renting a room. You can export your full React/Node.js codebase to GitHub at any time.

Q: How is the "Builder" different from others? A: Most builders run in shared, fragile web environments. VocoBuild provisions real Webcontainer infrastructure for every project. It is closer to AWS than it is to a playground.

Q: What happens when Phase 2 launches? A: Active subscribers will receive automatic access to VocoResearch and VocoStrategy tools as they roll out, likely at no additional cost for early adopters.
