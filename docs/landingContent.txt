📂 VocoWeb: Design & UX Documentation
1. Brand Identity: "The Foundry"
Core Concept: Industrial Software. VocoWeb is not a "no-code tool"; it is a Foundry. It melts down complexity and casts revenue.
Visual Metaphor: The Terminal / The Dashboard.
Palette:
Primary: Monochrome (White/Black).
Accent (Status): Signal Orange (#F97316) — Used specifically for "Alerts" (e.g., "Stripe Account Risk").
Success: Signal Green (#22C55E) — Used for "Revenue" and "Growth".
2. Component Architecture (Section by Section)
[Navigation Bar]
Structure: Fixed height (h-16), full-width bottom border.
Left (Identity): VocoWeb in Inter SemiBold. Next to it, a small pill tag: [ BETA v1.0 ] in Mono.
Right (Actions):
Links (Manifesto, Pricing, Login) in Mono, separated by vertical dividers (|).
CTA Button: [ Start Building ]. Solid Black background, White text. Sharp corners.
[Section 1: The Hero (The Promise)]
Layout: Left-aligned text, high negative space.
Typography:
Headline: Huge, tight tracking. "Stop Building" in Black, "Frankenstein Apps" in Strikethrough Gray, replaced by "Revenue Assets".
Sub-head: Readable width (max-w-2xl).
The "System Alert" (Guarantee):
Place the $10k/mo revenue guarantee inside a Status Badge.
Style: Thin border, light gray background, Green dot icon.
Text (Mono): GUARANTEE_PROTOCOL: $10K/MO REVENUE OR REFUND
Buttons:
Primary: [ Start Building ] (Black).
Helper Text: "No credit card required" (Mono, Gray).
[Section 2: The Anti-Pitch (Agitation)]
Design Pattern: The "Split Screen" or "Terminal Log".
Visual: A stark, two-column grid.
Left Column (The Hard Truth):
Headline: "THE HARD TRUTH" (Mono, Large).
Body: High-contrast typography. Use bolding for "technical debt" and "Stripe suspension".
Right Column (The Contrast):
Visual: A simple comparison list.
❌ AI Code = Spaghetti.
❌ Vercel = Deployment Hell.
✅ VocoWeb = Business Runtime.
[Section 3: The 3 Pillars (The Filter)]
Design Pattern: The Bento Grid (3 Vertical Cards).
Card Style:
White background, 1px Gray border.
Hover Effect: Border turns Black.
Content Layout (Inside Card):
Icon: Top Left. Simple, thin-stroke icon (e.g., a "Server" icon for Infrastructure, a "Shield" for Payments).
Title: Large, bold.
The Problem: Small text, Gray. [ PROBLEM: CONNECTION TIMEOUT ]
The Solution: Normal text, Black. "Managed MicroVMs."
Why this works: It creates a visual rhythm of "Problem -> Solution" in every card.
[Section 4: The Product Visualization]
Goal: Show, don't just tell.
Visual: A "Wireframe" screenshot of the dashboard.
Don't use a realistic screenshot (can look messy). Use a schematic representation.
Show three panels: Code Editor (Left), Revenue Graph (Top Right), SEO Traffic (Bottom Right).
The Feature List:
Display as a "System Check" list on the side.
[ OK ] Sandboxed Runtime
[ OK ] Global Payments
[ OK ] Auto-Scale DB
[Section 5: Pricing (The Intent Test)]
Design Pattern: The "Contract" (Term Sheet).
Toggle: A mechanical toggle switch (Black/White) for Monthly/Yearly.
Card 1: Builder ($39)
Style: White Card, Gray Border.
Vibe: Standard. "For Prototyping."
Button: [ Start Building ] (Outline).
Card 2: Founder ($79)
Style: Inverted. Solid Black Card, White Text.
Vibe: Premium, Serious. "For Shipping."
Highlight: The "Merchant of Record" feature should be highlighted in a white box inside the black card.
Button: [ Start Business ] (White Background, Black Text).
UX Note: This visual distinction (White vs. Black) forces the user to choose a "side" — Hobbyist vs. Professional.
[Section 6: FAQ (Handling Objections)]
Design Pattern: The "Accordion" List.
Style:
Questions in Inter SemiBold.
Answers in Mono (makes it feel like technical documentation).
Separated by full-width horizontal lines.
[Footer]
Style: The "Anchored Split" (Same as Sprint Zero).
Left: VocoWeb © 2026. Status: Operational.
Right: Twitter | LinkedIn | Terms.
3. Implementation Guide: The "Fake Door" Logic
This is the most critical part of the VocoWeb MVP. The design must support the intent tracking mechanism.

Mechanism A: The "Builder" Button ($39)
Visual Cue: Outline button. Looks "safe."
Interaction:
On Click -> Open Modal.
Modal Design: Minimalist. "Join the Waitlist."
Micro-copy: "We are currently onboarding batch #5. Secure your spot."
Metric: Count this as "Low Intent Lead."
Mechanism B: The "Founder" Button ($79)
Visual Cue: Solid White button on Black card. Looks "committed."
Interaction:
On Click -> Redirect to a new page (or Stripe Checkout).
The Page: A "Business Registration" form. Ask for "Company Name" and "Business Type."
Logic: Even if you don't actually process the $79 yet, the act of clicking a button that implies payment and filling out business details proves High Intent.
Metric: Count this as "Validated Customer."
4. Typography & Grid Rules (Summary)
Grid: All sections must align to a 12-column grid.
Spacing: Use py-24 (96px) for section padding.
Borders: Use border-b for every section to create the "stacked paper" look.
Icons: Use Lucide React or Phosphor Icons. Set stroke width to 1.5px (Thin/Technical).
