# 🎨 The Sprint Zero Design System (v1.0)

## 1. Core Philosophy

* **Concept:** "The Industrial Blueprint."
* **Keywords:** Precision, Velocity, Capital, Engineering.
* **Rule of Thumb:** If it doesn't convey data or structure, delete it. No gradients, no drop shadows, no rounded "friendly" corners. We are building a machine, not a playground.

## 2. Color Palette (Strict Monochrome)

We use a high-contrast system. We do not use "colors" in the traditional sense. Color is used only for *status* (e.g., Green = Online, Red = Offline).

| Role | Color Name | Hex Code | Usage Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Canvas** | `Paper White` | `#FFFFFF` | Background for 95% of the site. |
| **Surface** | `Off White` | `#FAFAFA` | Subtle background for "cards" or sections. |
| **Ink** | `Carbon` | `#0A0A0A` | Primary text. Not pure black (easier on eyes). |
| **Graphite** | `Steel` | `#525252` | Secondary text, descriptions, footnotes. |
| **Structure** | `Vapor` | `#E5E5E5` | Thin 1px borders. Defines the grid. |
| **Interaction** | `Pure Black` | `#000000` | Buttons, Active States, Links. |

**Status Colors (Use Sparingly):**

* 🟢 `Signal Green` (`#22C55E`): Validated, Open, Revenue.
* 🔴 `Signal Red` (`#EF4444`): Closed, Error, Risk.
* 🟡 `Signal Amber` (`#EAB308`): Beta, Limited Spots.

## 3. Typography (The "Venture" Stack)

Typography is the primary interface. We mix a **geometric sans-serif** (for reading) with a **terminal monospace** (for data).

### **A. Primary Font: `Inter` or `Geist Sans**`

* **Usage:** Headings, Paragraphs, Buttons.
* **Settings:**
* **Headings:** `tracking-tight` (-0.02em to -0.04em). Weight: `Medium` or `SemiBold`.
* **Body:** `tracking-normal`. Weight: `Regular`.
* **Leading (Line Height):** Tight for headings (1.1), Loose for body (1.6).



### **B. Secondary Font: `JetBrains Mono` or `Geist Mono**`

* **Usage:** Eyebrows, Tags, Data Points, Navigation Links, Footnotes.
* **Settings:**
* Always `Uppercase`.
* Small size (`text-xs` or `12px`).
* `tracking-widest` (0.05em to 0.1em) to make it look like a technical label.

## 4. Layout & Grid Principles

The design relies on a visible or implied **Grid**.

* **The Container:** Max-width `1152px` (6xl).
* **The Borders:** Sections are separated by full-width 1px solid borders (`border-neutral-200`).
* **The Bento Box:** Content is organized into rectangular "cards" or "cells."
* *Padding:* Generous inside cards (`p-8`).
* *Spacing:* Tight gaps between cards (`gap-4` or `gap-px`).


* **Alignment:** Everything aligns to the **Left**. No centered text (except strictly for isolated headlines).

## 5. Component Library

### **Buttons & Actions**

* **Primary Button:**
* Background: `#000000` (Black).
* Text: `#FFFFFF` (White).
* Shape: Sharp corners (`rounded-none` or `rounded-sm` max 2px).
* Hover: No fade. Instant color swap or slight lift.


* **Secondary Button:**
* Background: Transparent.
* Border: 1px Solid `#E5E5E5`.
* Text: `#0A0A0A`.



### **Cards (The "Features")**

* **Style:** Flat. No shadow.
* **Border:** 1px Solid `#E5E5E5`.
* **Interaction:** On hover, the border turns Black (`#000000`). This is a "micro-interaction" that signals focus.

### **Tags & Pills**

* **Style:** Small, rectangular labels.
* **Font:** Monospace, Uppercase.
* **Appearance:** Light Gray background (`#F5F5F5`) with Dark Gray text (`#525252`).

## 6. Motion & Interaction (Framer Motion)

Movement should feel "mechanical" and "snappy," not "floaty."

* **Transitions:** `duration: 0.2s`, `ease: "easeOut"`.
* **Scroll Reveal:** Elements do not "fade in." They **slide up** slightly (`y: 10`) and lock into place.
* **Stagger:** Lists (like the Pricing checklist) reveal one by one, very quickly (50ms delay between items).

---

## 7. Voice & Tone (Copywriting)

Your brand voice is **The Engineer-Founder**.

* **Do:** Be precise, numerical, and confident. Use words like *Protocol, Architecture, Deploy, Asset, Velocity, Infrastructure*.
* **Don't:** Be "friendly," "bubbly," or "salesy." Avoid exclamation marks (!). Avoid buzzwords like *Synergy, Passion, Journey*.

**Example:**

* ❌ *Bad:* "We love helping startups grow and we are super passionate about coding!"
* ✅ *Good:* "We engineer revenue-generating assets. From idea to deployment in 21 days."
