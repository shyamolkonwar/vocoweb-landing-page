[ HERO SECTION ]
The Sovereign Business Operating System.
From Concept to Exit. One Platform.
Most AI tools generate disposable code. VocoWeb architects sustainable companies. We combine an industrial-grade builder with a proprietary Compliance Kernel to automate the bureaucracy—Auth, Payments, and Legal—so you can focus on the product.

[ THE MASTER PLAN ]
We Are Not A Code Editor. We Are A Factory.
The modern stack is fragmented. VocoWeb is unified.

PHASE 1: THE FACTORY (LIVE)
VocoBuild Engine Generate clean, production-ready React & Node.js applications. Unlike competitors that run in fragile sandboxes, VocoWeb builds are deployed to Managed MicroVMs for true isolation and security.
Status: Available Now
PHASE 2: THE STANDARD LIBRARY (LIVE)
The Proprietary Kernel We don't "vibe code" security. We inject it. Every app ships with @vocoweb/kernel pre-installed—handling Authentication, Stripe Payments, and GDPR compliance via hard-coded, audited modules.
Status: Available Now
PHASE 3: THE INTELLIGENCE (ALPHA)
VocoStrategy & Research The AI Product Manager. Converting unstructured notes into formal Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and validating market demand before you write a single line of code.
Status: In Private Alpha
PHASE 4: THE OPERATIONS (BETA)
The Foundry Dashboard The integrated backbone for your business. Manage Users, view Analytics, and control your Revenue stream from a single "CEO View."
Status: Beta Access

[ FAQ ]
Honest & Direct.
Q: Why should I use this instead of Bolt or Replit? A: Bolt and Replit are "Code Toys." They are great for prototypes but break when you try to handle Payments, Auth, or Compliance. VocoWeb is a Business Foundry. We provide the "Boring" infrastructure (Kernel) that keeps your app legal, secure, and profitable.

Q: Do I own my code? A: Yes. We are a launchpad, not a prison. You can export your full source code to GitHub at any time. Our proprietary SDKs (@vocoweb/auth) are public npm packages, so your code continues to work even if you host it elsewhere.

Q: What is the "Kernel"? A: The Kernel is our proprietary Standard Library. Instead of asking AI to write insecure authentication code from scratch, we inject a pre-built, audited security module. This guarantees your app is safe and compliant by default.

Q: Is this GDPR compliant? A: Yes. We are built for the EU B2B Market. Our infrastructure defaults to EU regions, and our Kernel includes automated "Cookie Consent" and "Data Deletion" workflows required by European law.
